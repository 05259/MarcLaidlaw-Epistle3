# Marc Laidlaw's Epistle 3 Post. August 25th, 2017.
I'm archiving this for the world to see.

Here you can view the original version, as well as my corrected version which has all the obfuscated names switched back to the real names.

If you want to know what I changed in the name swaps, I made a rough list here:

"Playa" 			      : "Player"
"Gertie Fremont" 	  : "Gordon Freeman"
"Gertrude Fremont" 	: "Gordon Freeman"
"Hyperborea" 		    : "Borealis"
"Mrs. X" 			      : "G-Man"
"Disparate" 		    : "Combine"
"Jerry Maas" 		    : "Judith Mossman"
"Alex Vaunt" 		    : "Alyx Vance"
"Ghastlyhaunts" 	  : "Vortigaunts"
"Elly Vaunt" 	    	: "Eli Vance"
"Tocsin Island"     : "Aperture Science"
